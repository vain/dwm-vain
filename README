dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.


Extensions and changes of this fork
-----------------------------------

This fork is based on dwm-6.1. Major changes since then:

- Builtin function to re-execute dwm
- Included patches:
	- swapfocus
	- togglefullscreen
	- movestack
	- statusallmons
	- urgentborder
- Builtin layout for slinp (see https://github.com/vain/slinp)
- Double fork in spawn(): Child processes are now handed over to init
- Additional helper functions:
	- maximizefloater
	- centerfloater
	- shiftview: View adjacent tags
	- tagrel: Send a client to adjacent tags
- Pointer barriers around the working area
- A separator line below/above the status bar
- drawbar:
	- Only show occupied tags (allows you to use *A LOT* of tags)
	- List all visible clients (particularly useful in monocle mode)
	- Additional colors for info areas (taglist and status)
- tile layout:
	- Made "nmaster" dynamic, so it's actually more like a grid layout:
	  Try to have as many clients in the master column as there are in
	  the slave column. ("nmaster_dynamic_max" is a limit to this.)
	- Support for useless gaps
- Per-rule resize hints
